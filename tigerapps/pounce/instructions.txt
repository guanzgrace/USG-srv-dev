INSTRUCTIONS FOR UPDATING POUNCE FOR A NEW SEMESTER
--------------------------------------------------

1) Disable the current checker processes:
   - use ps aux to see the current checker processes
   - sudo kill -9 to kill them
   - comment out the two lines in crontab -e

2) Run 'python reset.py' to wipe the database

3) Change the semester code (e.g. "1154" for Spring 2015)
   in update.py.  This is the code that goes at the end of the 
   URL in the course offerings page.
   - remember to commit and push the changes

4) Run 'python updatenew.py' to scrape the new semester's courses

5) Make sure that everything (esp. emails) works 

6) Reenable the checker processes
   - un-comment in the two lines in crontab -e
