<h1>What is Wintersession?</h1>
<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;font-size:20px;">

Wintersession is a week-long program organized by USG to provide undergraduates with activities for
personal enrichment and community-building beyond what is offered during the
school year. Wintersession 2016 will take place during Intersession break, January 25-30, 2016.&nbsp;<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>

The program is designed to help students take advantage of their (rare) free time on campus during the gap in the academic year, encouraging and enabling students to pursue
formal and informal learning, academic and otherwise, and be part of a stronger
community on campus during the break. <br /><span></span><br /><span></span>

&nbsp;The motivation comes from similar programs offered at other
universities such as MIT's IAP (Independent Activities Period), Harvard
Wintersession, and Dartmouth&rsquo;s Winter Term, which provide students the
opportunity to explore interests ranging from dance to public speaking.&nbsp;<br /><br />

We're looking forward to putting a Princeton spin on it and having you involved!<br /><br />

Brought to you by USG members Jacob Cannon, Chris Hsu, Hunter Dong, and Lavinia Liang with thanks to sponsors from ODUS and the
Office of Campus Life.</div>
